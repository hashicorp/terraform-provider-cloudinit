# Terraform Provider: cloud-init

The cloud-init provider supports rendering [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io) configurations in a [MIME multi-part file](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/format.html#mime-multi-part-archive).

> _This provider is intended to replace the [template provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/template/). General templating can now be achieved through the [`templatefile`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/templatefile.html) function, without creating a separate data resource._ 
> _This provider exposes the `cloudinit_config` data source and resource, previously available as the [`template_cloudinit_config`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/template/d/cloudinit_config.html) in the template provider._

## Documentation, questions and discussions

Official documentation on how to use this provider can be found on the
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs).
In case of specific questions or discussions, please use the
HashiCorp [Terraform Providers Discuss forums](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-providers/31),
in accordance with HashiCorp [Community Guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines).

We also provide:

* [Support](.github/SUPPORT.md) page for help when using the provider
* [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines in case you want to help this project
* [Design](DESIGN.md) documentation to understand the scope and maintenance decisions

The remainder of this document will focus on the development aspects of the provider.


## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.19)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) (optional)

## Development

### Building

1. `git clone` this repository and `cd` into its directory
2. `make` will trigger the Golang build

The provided `GNUmakefile` defines additional commands generally useful during development,
like for running tests, generating documentation, code formatting and linting.
Taking a look at it's content is recommended.

### Testing

In order to test the provider, you can run

* `make test` to run provider tests
* `make testacc` to run provider acceptance tests

It's important to note that acceptance tests (`testacc`) will actually spawn
`terraform` and the provider. Read more about they work on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests).

### Generating documentation

This provider uses [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/)
to generate documentation and store it in the `docs/` directory.
Once a release is cut, the Terraform Registry will download the documentation from `docs/`
and associate it with the release version. Read more about how this works on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs).

Use `make generate` to ensure the documentation is regenerated with any changes.

### Using a development build

If [running tests and acceptance tests](#testing) isn't enough, it's possible to set up a local terraform configuration
to use a development builds of the provider. This can be achieved by leveraging the Terraform CLI
[configuration file development overrides](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).

First, use `make install` to place a fresh development build of the provider in your
[`${GOBIN}`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies)
(defaults to `${GOPATH}/bin` or `${HOME}/go/bin` if `${GOPATH}` is not set). Repeat
this every time you make changes to the provider locally.

Then, setup your environment following [these instructions](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/debugging#terraform-cli-development-overrides)
to make your local terraform use your local build.

### Testing GitHub Actions

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests) to realize its CI.

Sometimes it might be helpful to locally reproduce the behaviour of those actions,
and for this we use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act). Once installed, you can _simulate_ the actions executed
when opening a PR with:

```shell
# List of workflows for the 'pull_request' action
$ act -l pull_request

# Execute the workflows associated with the `pull_request' action 
$ act pull_request
```

## Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions, and it's defined in the Workflow
[release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml). To cut a release:

- Go to the repository in Github and click on the `Actions` tab.
- Select the `Release` workflow on the left-hand menu. 
- Click on the `Run workflow` button.
- Select the branch to cut the release from (default is main).
- Input the `Release version number` which is the Semantic Release number including the `v` prefix (i.e. `v1.4.0`) and click `Run workflow` to kickoff the release.
